## Projects

Links below point to my pdf files for the five projects I completed. I learned a lot and learned that I need to learn a lot more. Highly recommend taking this class or any classes Prof. Hung teaches. He teaches very clearly and one is able to grasp tough Mathematical concepts easily after he breaks it down.



1. [Classical Phase Plane Analysis](Projects/Project_1/Project 1.pdf)
2. [Analysis and Controller Design Using Lyapunovâ€™sDirect Method](Projects/Project_2/Project 2.pdf)
3. [Frequency Domain Analysis](Projects/Project_3/Project 3.pdf)
4. [Feedback Linearizing Control](Projects/Project_4/Project 4.pdf)
5. [Variable Structure & Backstepping Control](Projects/Project_5/Project 5.pdf)
